Welcome! I am a Carnatic Vocalist and also enjoy performing Bhaavageethe (emotive poetry). I was fortunate to have been introduced to music when I was little and my Carnatic Vocal training began at the age of four. Since then, music has been an amazing companion that I can always turn to, for comfort and inspiration. It never gave up on me even when I, busy with other things, almost gave up on it. I am currently a disciple of  [Dr. T S Sathyavathi](https://www.tssathyavathi.com), who constantly encourages and challenges me to become better everyday, even from the other side of the globe. In the past, I had the good fortune of learning from amazing Gurus - Carnatic Music from [Vidushi. Uma Kumar](https://musicearn.in/me/umakumar), Karnataka Kalasri Smt. Prasanna Kumari Satyam, Sri. Pandarinath and Smt. Usha, Sugama Sangeetha (light music) from [Sri. H K Narayana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._K._Narayana) and Smt. Geetha and Bharatanatyam dance from Smt. Sandhya Keshava Rao.

I'm always up for collaborating and creating beautiful music - feel free to [drop a message](mailto:shwetha.music.corner@gmail.com) and say Hi. For things not music, [my website]( https://shwetharam0407.github.io).
