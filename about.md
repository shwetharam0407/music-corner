Carnatic music is one of the two main subgenres of Indian classical music, practised in south India. I was fortunate to have been introduced to it when I was little and my Carnatic Vocal training began at the age of four. Since then, music has been an amazing companion that I can always turn to, for comfort and inspiration. It never gave up on me even when I, busy with other things, almost gave up on it. 

I am currently a disciple of the awesome [Dr. T S Sathyavathi](https://www.tssathyavathi.com), who constantly encourages and challenges me to become better everyday, even from the other side of the globe. In the past, I had the good fortune of learning from amazing Gurus -  [Vidushi. Uma Kumar](https://musicearn.in/me/umakumar), Smt. Prasanna Kumari Satyam, Sri Pandarinath and Smt. Usha. I also trained in Bharatanatyam with Guru Smt. Sandhya Keshava Rao for many years.
